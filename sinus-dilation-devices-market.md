<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sinus Dilation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Sinus Dilation</li><li>No-Balloon Sinus Dilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sinus dilation devices market is classified into two primary types: balloon sinus dilation and no-balloon sinus dilation. Balloon sinus dilation involves the use of a flexible balloon that is inserted into the sinus passages and inflated to widen the openings, promoting improved airflow and drainage, often used in minimally invasive procedures. No-balloon sinus dilation includes techniques that rely on other methods, such as tools or implants, to enhance sinus function without the use of a balloon. Both approaches aim to alleviate sinusitis symptoms and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
